# Introduction 
This is a twist on the classic game battleship. Players can challenge each other to sink as many ships as they can in 20 seconds. 

#How It Works 
The position of the ships are randomly generated in each "sea." Each square has been allocated a unique identifier via their attributes. If there is a "ship" 
at a square, the value of the square would be "true." When a player clicks on a square that is occupied, the square will turn red to 
indicate that there is a hit. 

#Technology Stack
I used HTML, CSS3, Javascript and jQuery.
